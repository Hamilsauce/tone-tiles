a curious case around, you might recall from our other discussions about my defineRulebook helper utility function thing, that all it does is take an object and each object's properties are just functions that run. So it's just an action table. there's no other abstraction to it. You import that and you just say save, and then you put the callback for save. You cancel, put the callback for cancel. And it centralizes everything and it's purposefully dumb and not jam-packed full of features. so I had been vocal about this thing but as i said he's a rail gun satellite that just happens to drift by at the right time. And so he saw me rename something that was around that the business rules thing. And he said that he noticed that the parameters were any, and we should think about tightening that and blah blah blah blah. Uh, he asked me what I, what I was thinking about for the future of it. And so I gave him kind of the big spiel of just this is supposed to be anti, I mean, this is supposed to be just almost structural documentation. It should not influence anything at any time. And the reason that that's any for the callback parameters is because the rulebook doesn't care what the callback parameters take. You know, the rulebook, it's only thing to do is to encode semantics and structure for human and ai legibility. he didn't push back on that, though.
